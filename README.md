# Network Interdiction
Code for the paper **The All-Pairs Vitality-Maximization (VIMAX) Problem**.

# Data

The **Data** folder contains the AMPL files for the random and grid networks used. The drug networks used are from the paper below and are not found in the folder. The **SimpData** folder contains the AMPL files for the simplified networks after running our graph simplification procedure.
